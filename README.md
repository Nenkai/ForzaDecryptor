# ForzaDecryptor

A C# tool that decrypts FH5's TransformIT encrypted files - zips, files and game database.

Encryption is not possible for certain files - asymetric encryption is used and the private encryption keys are not availavle.

## BXML
Also contains a BXML (Binary XML) to XML converter.

## History
Made solely by me around mid-2022, making it public as it's been mostly figured by other people publicly now. Keys have not been changed since.
