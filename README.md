# ForzaTools

A set of tools to work around Forza games.

## ForzaDecryptor

Decrypts FH5's TransformIT encrypted files - zips, files and game database.

Encryption is not possible for certain files - asymetric encryption is used and the private encryption keys are not available.

**Keys are not currently included in this repository.** This should be used as a reference instead.

### History
Made solely by me around mid-2022, making it public as it has mostly been figured by other people recently and publicly, aswell as for previous games. Keys for FH5 have not been changed since.

This tool was initially private due to its nature of it affecting current supported games.

## BXML
BXML <-> XML converter.

## ForzaDBLoadPatcher

Allows the game to run decrypted databases (currently FH4 only)

## ForzaUtils

Various utilities (hashing primarily)
